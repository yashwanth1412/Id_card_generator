# Id_card_generator

Id card generator is a simple GUI application where students register their details for id card.
Admin has access to these details and can update, delete or add details.
In this project, I used MySQL database to store the details of the students and Javafx for Graphical User Interface.

The main files for the project are stored in application package. The database package consists of the files related to database.
The execution of the program starts from Main.java file which is located at id_card_generator/src/application.
